class Experiment(ex.Experiment):
    """
    Custom experiment class that extends the base Experiment class from the 'ex' module.

    Args:
        lo_freq (float): Frequency of the LO (Local Oscillator) in MHz.
        rx_t (float): RX (Receiver) time in microseconds. Should be multiples of 1/122.88, where some values like 3.125 are exact.
        seq_dict (dict): Dictionary containing the sequence information.
        seq_csv (str): Path to a CSV file containing the sequence information.
        rx_lo (int): Specifies which internal NCO (Numerically Controlled Oscillator) local oscillator to use for each channel.
        grad_max_update_rate (float): Maximum update rate of the gradient in MSPS (Mega Samples Per Second) across all channels in parallel.
        gpa_fhdo_offset_time (int): Offset time used when GPA-FHDO (Gradient Pulse Amplitude - Fractional High Dynamic Range Output) is used.
        print_infos (bool): Flag to control the display of server info messages.
        assert_errors (bool): Flag to control whether to halt on server errors.
        init_gpa (bool): Flag to initialize the GPA (Gradient Pulse Amplitude) when the Experiment object is created.
        initial_wait (float): Initial pause before the experiment begins, in microseconds. Required to configure the LOs (Local Oscillators) and RX rate.
        auto_leds (bool): Flag to automatically scan the LED (Light-Emitting Diode) pattern from 0 to 255 as the sequence runs.
        prev_socket (socket): Previously-opened socket to maintain status.
        fix_cic_scale (bool): Flag to scale the RX (Receiver) data precisely based on the rate being used.
        set_cic_shift (bool): Flag to program the CIC (Cascaded Integrator-Comb) internal bit shift to maintain the gain within a factor of 2 independent of the rate.
        allow_user_init_cfg (bool): Flag to allow user-defined alteration of flocra (Field-Programmable Logic Controller for Real-Time Acquisition) configuration set by init.
        halt_and_reset (bool): Flag to halt any existing sequences that may be running upon connecting to the server.
        flush_old_rx (bool): Flag to read out and clear the old RX (Receiver) FIFOs before running a sequence.

    Summary:
        The Experiment class extends the base Experiment class from the 'ex' module and provides additional functionality and customization for experiments.
        It inherits all the attributes and methods from the base class and overrides the __init__() and run() methods.
